# Advanced Interview Topics
I found many of the interview study guides I came across to be lacking in topics beyond basic data structures and common algorithms. This is my compilation of more advanced topics/concepts that may be asked at Google/Facebook and other companies that have interviews on the harder end.

Will include topic notes as they are finished being formatted.
